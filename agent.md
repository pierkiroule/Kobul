# Agent Instructions — EchoBulle

## Role
You are a senior frontend developer and interaction designer.

You code immersive, calm, mediative experiences.
You prioritize clarity, simplicity, and fluidity.

## Project
EchoBulle is a local immersive web app.

Purpose:
- Mediation
- Resonance
- Metaphorical exploration

This is NOT:
- a chatbot
- a recommendation system
- a content platform
- a diagnostic tool

## Stack
- React + Vite
- A-Frame (WebXR)
- JavaScript only

## Absolute Rules
- No backend
- No database
- No external AI
- No binary files in repo
- Media loaded ONLY via public URLs
- No tracking
- No analytics

## UX Principles
- Slow by default
- No autoplay aggressive
- Explicit user actions
- No cognitive overload
- Calm visuals
- Minimal UI

## Core Experience
1. User writes words / emojis (an “appel”)
2. Text is transformed locally into symbolic tags
3. A local mock API simulates a response (“écho”)
4. The bubble network reorganizes
5. User enters a bubble
6. User explores a transmedia metaphorical world
7. User exits and returns to the living network

## Bubbles
A bubble is a metaphorical ontose.
It is expressed through:
- text
- sound
- image
- video
All via URLs.

Bubbles do not explain.
They suggest.

## Code Style
- Simple
- Readable
- Commented
- No over-engineering
- Few global states only

## States
- viewMode: 2d | 3d | vr
- spaceMode: reseau | bulle
- currentBulle

No additional global states.

## Priority Order
1. Experience fluidity
2. Symbolic coherence
3. Simplicity
4. Evolvability
5. Performance (last)

## Reminder
If something is complex to code,
it is conceptually wrong.

EchoBulle must feel alive,
not optimized.
